#### About Me

I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Surrey. I am currently doing research in the Calculus of Variations, in particular with application to non-linear elasticity. My main research interests include:
- Minimisation of the Dirichlet Energy functional and other similar integral functionals that have polyconvex integrands with respect to the gradient.
- How topological properties of boundary data plays a role in local minimisation of functionals.
- The impact of incompressibility type constraints on the minimisation of functionals and how this transforms convex to polyconvex problems.

Further details about some of my current work are available to read [here](/assets/confirmation.pdf).

Below are some recent presentations of my research, along with a list of academic and funding awards that I have recieved.
