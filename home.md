#### About Me

I am a PhD student in the Department of Mathematics at the University of Surrey. I am currently doing research in the Calculus of Variations, in particular with application to non-linear elasticity. My main research interests include:
- Minimisation of the Dirichlet Energy functional and other similar integral functionals that have polyconvex integrands with respect to the gradient.
- How topological properties of boundary data plays a role in local minimisation of functionals.
- The impact of incompressibility type constraints on the minimisation of functionals and how this transforms convex to polyconvex problems.


Below are some recent presentations of my research, along with a list of academic and funding awards that I have recieved.
